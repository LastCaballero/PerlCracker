# Find own solutions instead of copying code from the web...
It is about programing your own way instead of looking at tutorials in the web copying code from someone else.
At the end programming is to find a solution for a problem. It is 1000 times better to find your own solution than to use simply solutions of other programmers, AI and so on. Ohter benefit is, that you learn much more than the tipically professional programmer.
